# Notes
In this exercise located on page 40 I learned a couple of interesting things, including:

1. A worthwhile definition for transports: A connection between two endpoints.
2. A worthwhile definitino for protocols: How to process network events asynchronously.
3. The design pattern of calling an internal function when processing the connectionMade() event.
4. The python `global` keyword, which creates global variables from a local context
5. Learned that the server uses the `reactor.listenTCP()` method and the client uses the `reactor.connectTCP()` method
